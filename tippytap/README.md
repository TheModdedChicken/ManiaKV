# Tippy Tap
Does the tippity tap tap with the wap bap bap. (Bongo Cat Key Visualizer)

The goal of this project is to make a highly customizable and intuitive key visualizer.

## Features
**Note**: This application is still early in development and is NOT in a functional state, so none of the features are here yet.

- [ ] Customizables
	- [ ] Body
	- [ ] Instrument
	- [ ] Hands
	- [ ] Table
	- [ ] Background
- [ ] Hotkeys: Add hotkeys to key setups for faster scene/config swapping
- [ ] Higher Character Count: More than two characters at a time on screen
- [ ] Custom Events: This application is mainly supposed to be for VSRGs (Visual Scrolling Rhythm Games) such as osu! or FNF. However, later down the line I plan to add custom events allowing for things like full keyboards and mice/drawing tablets. (Later in development)
- [ ] Twitch Chat Commands: Adds twitch chat user interactivity allowing for things like command activated custom events. (Later in development)

## Build
Will update when the application released

## Credit
This project is supposed to be an unofficial successor to [malad1211's](https://github.com/malad1211) project called [Mania-Cat](https://github.com/malad1211/Mania-Cat). 
I was originally going to fork it but I ran into issues with the main library they were using so I decided to create a new application with [raylib](https://github.com/raysan5/raylib).

Also, thanks to [Floatyoats](https://github.com/Floatyoats) for suggesting I make this :D
